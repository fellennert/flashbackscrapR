# flashbackscrapR

Install it: you can simply install it by using `devtools::install_github("fellennert/flashbackscrapR")`. Please note the capitalization of the R.
If you are new to the package, you might want to get the vignette as well. In this case, please run `devtools::install_github("fellennert/flashbackscrapR", build_vignettes = TRUE)`. Then, all the packages which are required are installed automatically, too. This process might take some time. You can then open the vignette using the code `browseVignettes("flashbackscrapR")` and choosing *HTML*.
